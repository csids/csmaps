## fhiverse

The `fhiverse` is a set of R packages developed by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health to help solve problems that frequently occur when performing infectious disease surveillance.

If you want to install the dev versions (or access packages that haven't been released on CRAN), run `usethis::edit_r_profile()` to edit your `.Rprofile`. Then write in:

```
options(repos=structure(c(
  FHI="https://folkehelseinstituttet.github.io/drat/",
  CRAN="https://cran.rstudio.com"
)))
```

Save the file and restart R. This will allow you to install `fhiverse` packages from the FHI registry.

Current `fhiverse` packages are:
